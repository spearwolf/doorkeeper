# doorkeeper

A simple and unobtrusive token management service.

This is a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web service, written in javascript and built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

As token database backend an internal _in memory store_ (development) can be used or alternatively a [redis](https://redis.io/) store (production).

## Service Endpoints

### Create Token

```
POST /token
```

| parameter | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `login` | login id |
| `password` | login secret |

Create a new token. You will need to send the `login` and `password` parameters.
The service will accept the parameters only as _form_ or _json_ encoded body data.

Returns a _signed_ [jwt token](https://jwt.io/).


### Verify Token

```
GET /token
```

Verify and return the token payload as json.
You need to pass your token as header parameter: `Authorization: Bearer XYZ123`.
Returns the token payload data as *json* object. Returns with an error (`400 Bad Request`) if the token can not be verified.


### Get Public Token Key

```
GET /token/public.pem
```

Get the public key which is needed if you want to verify the signed token by yourself.


### Destroy All Tokens

```
DELETE /tokens
```

Destroy all tokens.

You need to pass your token as header parameter: `Authorization: Bearer xyz123`.


## Development Environment

### Setup

As a prerequisite, you need a **node v16+** and a current **docker** environment installed.

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Testing

Run `npm test` for running all tests from [test/*](./test/*) against a local in-memory database.

Using `npm run test:redis:run` will use docker-compose to run all tests against a dockerized redis instance.

Or just use `npm run test:all` to run all tests against both environments (intended for ci).

For development `npm run test:watch` is meant, which _only_ test against the in-memory database, but restarts the tests every time the sources have changed. very useful for development :)

> NOTE: at the moment we use _mocha_ as test runner and not _jest_ because _jest_ support for es6 imports is still experimental AND _jest_ runs incredibly slow in a docker context :(

### Run a local server

In order to run a local server, you need to start a redis instance:

```sh
$ npm run dev:redis:up
```

After that, you can start a local server with:

```sh
$ npm start
# .. or use:
$ npm run watch
```

This will start a server listening on http://localhost:6100 and restart the application when a source file changed.

> for the very lazy `npm run dev` is meant ... this starts both a redis instance and then immediately the server in watch mode


### Build docker image

To create a release version and build the docker image, simply run:

```sh
$ npm run docker:build
```

Start the docker container with `npm run docker:run` (or use `docker:start` which starts the doorkeeper service in the background) or run an interactive shell session via `npm run docker:run:shell`
